# jv-md-budget-tracker

The purpose of this project was to create a full CRUD application using Django, Python, HTML, Javascript, CSS, BootStrap, and a PostgreSQL database. We set out to make a budget sheet where users can input data regarding their spending habits. Users can input how much they've spent or earned, the medium of earning/spending, when, and a short description of the event. 

Using Django's specific MVT (Models, Views, Templates) structure we were able to carry out basic functionality. 

We also implemented user authentication with use of Django's embedded authentication system. It allowed us to allow users to have individualized budget sheets so that entries were to their respective owners.

Improvements:

We would like to implement charts and other ways to represent the data so that the user can visualize things easier. 

We also would like to implement more features such as a search function, sort by date/time, and introduce an additional model to help the user formulate goals to achieve in budgeting.
